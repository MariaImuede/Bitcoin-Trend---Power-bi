## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze historical trends of Bitcoin from 2011 to 2021 using Power BI and provide insights and recommendations based on the data analysis. The analysis will focus on key metrics such as average weighted price, total currency volume exchanged, total volume of Bitcoin traded, highest and lowest prices, open and close price comparison, and average weighted price in key years. By examining these metrics, the objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin's market performance over the decade and identify potential investment opportunities and strategies for stakeholders in the cryptocurrency market.

### Steps followed 


Step 1: Open Power BI Desktop and select "Get Data" from the Home tab. Choose the relevant data source (e.g., Excel, CSV) containing the Bitcoin historical data. Navigate to the location of the file and select it to import the data into Power BI.

Step 2: Once the data is imported, Power BI will display a preview of the data. Review the data structure and perform any necessary data cleaning tasks in the Query Editor, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data types as needed.

Step 3: In the Query Editor, profile the data to gain insights into key metrics such as average weighted price, total currency volume exchanged, and total volume of Bitcoin traded. Use filters and aggregations to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns.

Step 4: Create visualizations by selecting fields from the Fields pane and dragging them onto the canvas. Choose appropriate visualization types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, tables) to represent the analyzed data effectively and facilitate insights discovery.

Step 5: Customize visualizations and dashboards to present key insights in a clear and concise manner. Add titles, labels, and legends to provide context and enhance readability. Arrange visualizations on the canvas to create a logical flow of information.

Step 6: Incorporate interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data dynamically. Add slicers for fields like year, month, and price level to enable targeted analysis.

Step 7: Use calculated measures and KPIs to quantify key metrics and performance indicators relevant to Bitcoin's historical trends. Create measures to calculate metrics such as average weighted price in key years, highest and lowest prices, and open and close price comparisons.

Step 8: Validate insights and findings by cross-referencing data from different visualizations and exploring relationships between variables. Conduct thorough analysis to identify correlations and causal relationships that can inform actionable recommendations.

Step 9: Generate a summary of key insights and recommendations based on the analysis conducted. Clearly articulate findings related to Bitcoin's average weighted price trends, historical price levels, and potential investment strategies. Propose actionable recommendations to guide investment decisions based on historical data trends.

Step 10: Share the insights and recommendations with relevant stakeholders using Power BI's sharing and collaboration features. Export visualizations and dashboards as reports or presentations to communicate findings effectively and facilitate decision-making processes.

# Insights

1. Average Weighted Price Trends: The analysis reveals that the average weighted price of Bitcoin over the decade was approximately $4,470. There were notable fluctuations in Bitcoin prices over the years, with significant increases observed from 2017 to 2021.

2. Total Currency Volume Exchanged: The total currency volume exchanged in Bitcoin transactions during the period amounted to $150.92 billion. This indicates the substantial economic activity and market liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

3. Total Volume of Bitcoin Traded: The total volume of Bitcoin traded reached approximately 33.69 million BTC, reflecting the widespread adoption and trading activity of Bitcoin within the cryptocurrency market.

4. Highest and Lowest Prices: The analysis highlights the highest and lowest prices of Bitcoin in previous years, with notable fluctuations observed. Understanding these price dynamics can provide insights into market sentiment and potential investment opportunities.

5. Open and Close Price Comparison: Comparing the open and close prices of Bitcoin from 2017 to 2020 reveals insights into price trends and trading patterns over time. The data shows variations in open and close prices across different years, indicating market volatility and price movement.

6. Average Weighted Price in Key Years: The analysis identifies key years with significant average weighted prices for Bitcoin, such as 2018 and 2020. These years experienced higher-than-average price levels, suggesting potential periods of growth and investment opportunities.

# Recommendations:
1. Long-term Investment Consideration: Given Bitcoin's significant increase in average weighted price from 2017 to 2021, investors with a long investment horizon and risk tolerance may consider holding Bitcoin for the long term. This strategy aligns with the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a store of value and hedge against inflation.

2. Utilizing Historical Price Levels: Historical data reveals that Bitcoin maintained its value above $3.8 billion for consecutive years (2017 to 2020), indicating potential support levels during price corrections. Investors can use these historical price levels as reference points for entry and exit strategies, helping to manage risk in their investment portfolios.

3. Diversification Strategy: While Bitcoin has shown strong performance, spreading investments across multiple cryptocurrencies can help manage risk and diversify investment portfolios. Investors should consider allocating funds to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies to mitigate single-asset risk and capture potential upside opportunities in different market segments.

4. Strategic Investment Planning: Given the significant average weighted prices observed in key years such as 2018 and 2020, investors should strategically plan their investments based on historical price trends. By analyzing historical data and identifying potential periods of growth, investors can optimize their investment strategies and capitalize on favorable market conditions.

5. Monitoring Market Trends: Continuously monitoring market trends and analyzing historical data is essential for informed decision-making in the cryptocurrency market. Investors should stay updated on price movements, market sentiment, and regulatory developments to adapt their investment strategies accordingly and capitalize on emerging opportunities.
